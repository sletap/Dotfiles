        then npm start, and it should start the application through windows

Run a command in powershell through WSL:

Python venving:
        python3 -m venv env

        # This is a comment
        type whatever the command needs to do
        chmod +x yourScript #this gives the script permissions
        sudo cp yourScript /usr/bin/ #Script needs to go here
        # sometimes it's hard...
